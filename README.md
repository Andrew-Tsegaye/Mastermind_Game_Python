# Mastermind Game Python

The Mastermind game is a code-breaking game where the player tries to guess the secret code created by another player or the computer. The secret code consists of a combination of colors, and the player has to guess the correct sequence of colors. After each guess, the player receives feedback in the form of black and white pegs. A black peg indicates that one of the colors in the guess is correct and in the correct position, while a white peg indicates that one of the colors in the guess is correct but in the wrong position. The player continues to guess the code until the correct sequence is found.

This game can be implemented in Python using various programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and arrays. The code logic can be simple or complex, depending on the features and complexity desired for the game.
